            Universities in America, Europe and Israel do not search for knowledge for the sake of science, nor do they search for knowledge in 
            order to raise the social position of man and his network of relations to origin, life and destiny .. Rather, they are there looking for
            knowledge and work as an element of strength necessary for success in the process of international conflict.
            As for in the Arab and Islamic countries, the state of knowledge and knowledge is like the case of gold among the women of these 
            countries. They remain merely an ornament in which individuals and diploma holders boast each other at home.

            Halima is back to her old habit"; It is said to everyone who returns to an old habit, because Halima is the wife of one of the characters
            who was famous for generosity, while she was famous for being miserly, and if she wanted to put fat in cooking and took the spoon to
            tremble in her hand, then her husband wanted to teach her generosity, so he said to her: The ancient people used to say that Whenever a 
            woman put a spoonful of ghee in a basket, God increased her life a day, so Halima took more tablespoons of ghee in cooking until her food
            became good and her hands became accustomed to generosity, and God wanted to mourn her with her only son whom she loved more than herself,
            so she was terrified until she wished to die, and she took She reduces the amount of spoons of butter in the cooking until her age decreases
